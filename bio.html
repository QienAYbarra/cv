        <h2>My full story of my love for Technology.</h2>
        <p class="bio-greeting">I started learning to program at 9 years old because I have always wanted to have a huge and popular website. Maybe even a business. To start making my own video games. To be known. When I was introduced to coding, it was because my father saw I had it in me. I loved playing on my little toddler electronics and would never stop. My first line of code EVER was: print("Hello World").  Then was when a nerd part of me kicked in! THEN is when I knew what I wanted to be! THEN... then is when I knew that I wanted to be a <span class="pro">known and special programmer!</span> </p>
        <p class="bio-greeting">I started to study hard into programming. I always tryed to get it right on first try... to get it looking nice... to get it perfect! From then, till' now, I have loved technology, programming and gaming. My <span class="pro">Master Goal</span> is to make tech that make people happy. I wanna help people so bad. To make websites that Millions will love and to be greatly known for what I do.</p>
        <h2>Thank you so, so much for viewing my bio!</h2>
        <h3>I hope you enjoyed my story. :)</h3>
